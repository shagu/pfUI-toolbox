# pfUI-toolbox
The pfUI-toolbox includes some ugly scripts to automatically generate and extract locale related content and other data from the client and databases. It is recommended to clone this repository side by side to your pfUI installation.

    $ ls -1
    pfUI/
    pfUI-toolbox/

Hint: If you only want to update the translation tables, you won't need to follow the dependency and database server setup.

## Dependencies
You'll need an up to date linux system with `wine`, `php`, `mariadb-clients` and `lxc` installed.

## Setup a database lxc container
Make sure you have `lxc` installed on your host and /etc/lxc/default.conf includes `lxc.net.0.type = none`.
Select `apache2` as webserver when asked and use `mangos` as password for your database connections.

    lxc-create -n pfUI -t ubuntu
    lxc-start  -n pfUI
    lxc-attach -n pfUI

    echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" > /etc/resolv.conf
    apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
    apt-get install phpmyadmin mariadb-server wget p7zip

Grab and install the latest database from elysium's [github page](https://github.com/elysium-project/database/tree/master/full_db). Also install aowow's sql tables for additional informations and correlation tables.

    wget https://github.com/elysium-project/database/raw/master/full_db/world_1.12_AUG08_2017.7z.7z
    p7zip -d world_*.7z

    mysql -u root
    > CREATE DATABASE mangos DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
    > CREATE USER 'mangos'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'mangos';
    > GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, ALTER, LOCK TABLES ON mangos.* TO 'mangos'@'localhost';
    > flush privileges;
    > quit;

    mysql -u mangos -p mangos < world_*.sql

    wget https://github.com/shagu/ShaguQuest/raw/master/database/aowow.sql
    mysql -u mangos -p mangos < aowow.sql

## Generate DBC Files
Copy `tools/ad` to your world of warcraft directory and run it. You'll receive an `dbc/` folder with many of `*.dbc` files inside. Copy the `Spell.dbc` to pfUI-toolbox' `DBC/` folder as `DBC/Spell_enUS.dbc` where `enUS` should be replaced with the client localization you've used. In my case, I've used the extractor on every available gameclient and my folder looks like this:

    $ ls -1 DBC/
    Spell_deDE.dbc
    Spell_enUS.dbc
    Spell_esES.dbc
    Spell_frFR.dbc
    Spell_koKR.dbc
    Spell_ruRU.dbc
    Spell_zhCN.dbc


## Run the Toolchain
You're now ready to generate the locale dependent content. At the beginning you should instruct `make` to prepare everything. This has to be done to parse all DBC files into CSV and also generate SQL files which will be installed to your database.

    make prepare

The SQL-Update might take a while, depending on your DBCs. Finally you're ready to run the makefile without any parameters to generate everything. You can also only generate files seperately.

    make                # will run "critters", "debuffs", "spells" and "interrupts"

    make prepare        # Clean old files, convert dbc into csv and sql files and updates the database
    make critters       # Build out/critter_$loc.lua. A list of all critters ingame.
    make debuffs        # Build out/debuffs_$loc.lua. A list of all debuffs and their duration.
    make spells         # Build out/spells_$loc.lua. A list of all spells, their casttime and icon.
    make interrupts     # Build out/interrupts_$loc.lua. A list of all known interrupts, generated by the ./lists/interrupts.txt

    make translations   # Update all pfUI translation tables, sort them and add missing T[""] values.
